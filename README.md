## üß† Feature Engineering Strategy

### RFM Model Implementation

**Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) Analysis** - The gold standard for customer segmentation:

- **Recency (R)**: Days since last purchase
  ```python
  Recency = (snapshot_date - last_purchase_date).days
  ```

- **Frequency (F)**: Total number of unique transactions
  ```python
  Frequency = customer_transactions.nunique()
  ```

- **Monetary (M)**: Total customer lifetime value
  ```python
  Monetary = sum(Quantity √ó UnitPrice)
  ```

### Additional Engineered Features
- `TotalQuantity`: Cumulative items purchased
- `AvgUnitPrice`: Average price point preference
- `TotalPrice`: Revenue contribution per customer
